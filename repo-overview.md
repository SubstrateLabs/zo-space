# Zo Space – Repo Overview

Zo Spaces is a collection of interactive web pages that a user creates with the help of Zo's AI agent.

A Zo Space derives from a base repo that includes many starter pieces. We will build on top of this template repo to help users build custom pages that fit their needs. You are allowed to install any npm dependencies if they help in serving the user's needs.

Use this document as a reference for the project structure, conventions, and common tasks.

> **Tip** Webpack paths: the alias `@` resolves to `src/`, so prefer to import via this path prefix, e.g. `import Button from "@/components/ui/button"`

## 3. Dependencies

• **Node.js >= 18** (dependencies managed through plain npm).

---

### 4.2 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the repo root (automatically picked up by Vite):

```dotenv
VITE_ZO_USER=alice # global ZO user name, provided by the system
```

Additional variables you add that start with `VITE_` are automatically inlined into the front-end at build time.

## 5. Common Tasks

### 5.1 Add a New Page

1. Create `src/pages/<name>.tsx` (convention: `pages/foo/bar.tsx` → route `/foo/bar`).
2. Export your component as the default:

```tsx
export default function MyPage() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}

// Optional: mark as private (only visible in dev mode)
export const isPrivate = true;
```

| Command             | What it does                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript project-wide type checking                     |
| `npm run lint`      | Run ESLint over `src/`                                    |

## 8. Conventions & Tips

• **Component Library** The `src/components/ui/` folder contains autogenerated shadcn wrappers around Radix primitives. Generate more with `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component>`. The complete registry can be looked up online.

• **Theming** Global CSS variables live in `src/index.css`. User specified themes live in `src/user-theme.css`. These user-themes are not to be modified directly and are autogenerated from their preferences. Prefer using shadcn color aliases like `bg-primary`, `text-secondary`, `accent`, `muted` etc. for consistency.

• **Absolute Imports** Use `@/` instead of relative `../../` paths.

• **TypeScript** `tsconfig.json` is configured to help with catching errors at build time.
